            <h2 class = 'spacer'>🇲🇽 About Me 🇯🇵</h2> 
            <p>I'm half Japanese half Mexican and was born and raised in Australia. I'm currently a <strong> final year student at EHL </strong> and am excited to graduate in July! I love all things travel and love meeting new people </p>

            <h2 class="text-blue">Professional Work 📂</h2>
            <p>I've had the chance to work in 6 different countries and want to continue getting out of my comfort zone and experiencing new ways of living. I thrive in challenging environments and am always eager to learn something new. After graduating, I want to work in either sports marketing, consulting, or technology in travel, and hope to one day contribute to society by going into the education sector as well 📚</p>

            <h2>What I want to learn 🧠</h2>
            <p>In this class, I hope to learn the basics of <strong> HTML and CSS </strong> so that I can better understand what it means to create a website. I hope to utilise this knowledge in the future when I (hopefully) go into the tech sector at some point later on in my life 💻</p>
